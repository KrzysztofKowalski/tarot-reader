# Tarot Reader

This app provides a basic tarot card reference and a simple spread generator.

It was made to practice creating a simple React app from scratch(ish). It's functionally done but the design is kinda just wireframed at this point. Oh, this project also uses [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) for some basic CSS normalization, utilities and buttons. Nothing fancy.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The tarot images, descriptions and interpretations were borrowed from [winterlightning's Tarot repot](https://github.com/winterlightning/Tarot).
